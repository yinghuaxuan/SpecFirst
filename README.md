# SpecFirst
SpecFirst is a .NET source generator to automatically generate tests in target frameworks from [decision tables](https://github.com/yinghuaxuan/spec-first/blob/develop/tests/SpecFirst.Specs/DecisionTable/Validator/DecisionTable.spec.md) authored in markdown.

## The goal
- Test specs as your documentation / communication / collaboration tool
- Seamless integration with Visual Studio
- Generate tests in your favourite framework (currently your favourite has to be xUnit)
- Reduce the complexity in authoring and maintaining tests
